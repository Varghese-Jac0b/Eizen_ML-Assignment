1) The traditional softmax function can lead to poor generalization on out-of-distribution data, where the model may be overconfident in its predictions.

2) The paper proposes a new loss function called the bi-tempered logistic loss, which incorporates a temperature scaling parameter to provide more robust predictions and better generalization.

3) The bi-tempered logistic loss function introduces two temperature scaling parameters, t1 and t2, which control the shape of the loss function and the degree of confidence in the predictions.

4) The paper also introduces a new softmax function called the tempered softmax, which is used in conjunction with the bi-tempered logistic loss function. The tempered softmax function introduces a temperature scaling parameter, t2, to provide more robust predictions.

5) The paper presents experiments on several image classification datasets, showing that the bi-tempered logistic loss function and tempered softmax function can significantly improve performance over traditional softmax-based methods.
